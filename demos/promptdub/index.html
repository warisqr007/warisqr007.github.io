        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
Expressive text-to-speech (TTS) for automated dubbing often misses time-varying emotion and lacks multimodal grounding, which hurts cinematic dubbing quality. We propose PromptDub, the first multimodal controllable dubbing pipeline that integrates vision, audio, and language cues into transparent prompts for expressive TTS. Vision- and audio-language models summarize scene, performance, and delivery; an LLM fuses them into brief, editable directions. We then train a TTS that conditions on these fine-grained prompts and the script to synthesize speech aligned to emotion and timing. We also introduce an emotion-trajectory metric using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to assess temporal coherence. Our evaluation showed PromptDub improved global emotion similarity to 0.90 (vs. 0.87), reduces DTW by up to 54%, and is preferred by listeners in ABX tests by 82% for emotion/prosody matching over state-of-the-art baselines.

                                1. Speaker Voice Characteristics: The speaker is a male, likely in his mid-twenties, with a voice that is slightly strained and carries a hint of weariness, possibly due to stress or fatigue.<br>
                                2. Primary Emotional State: The primary emotion conveyed by the speaker is a sense of frustration and irritation, which is palpable through their labored breathing and tense vocal delivery.<br>
                                3. Emotional Layers and Nuance: Underlying this primary emotion, there is also a noticeable undertone of sadness and disappointment. This is evident from the speaker's slow pace and low pitch, which suggest a more profound emotional state than mere annoyance.<br>
                                4. Emotional Progression: Throughout the audio, the speaker's frustration appears to escalate, culminating in a moment of heightened emotion where their voice cracks, indicating a breaking point in their emotional state.<br>
                                5. Supporting Vocal Indicators: Vocal indicators such as the roughness and strain in the speaker's voice, coupled with their labored breathing and fluctuating pitch, support the analysis of a complex emotional landscape.<br>
                                6. Acoustic Environment: The acoustic environment seems to contribute to the overall emotional tone, with a reverberant quality suggesting a large, open space, possibly indicative of a public or formal setting. The lack of background noise allows for a clear focus on the speaker's voice and emotional expression.<br>
                                7. Overall Emotional Description: In summary, the speaker's voice conveys a deep-seated combination of frustration, sadness, and weariness, reflecting a complex emotional landscape that is both intense and nuanced.<br>

                                1. Scene Setting: The scene is set in a formal office environment with wooden paneling and large windows covered by blinds, creating an atmosphere of seriousness and professionalism.<br>
                                2. Speaker Demographics: The speaker appears to be a middle-aged man wearing glasses, dressed in a brown suit, white shirt, and striped tie, suggesting a professional or academic background.<br>
                                3. Actions: The man in the suit is seated at a desk, speaking animatedly while gesturing with his right hand and occasionally taking sips from a glass of water.<br>
                                4. Character Interactions: The man in the suit is engaged in a conversation with another person who is partially visible on the left side of the frame, indicating a discussion or interview setting.<br>
                                5. Emotional Expression: The man's facial expressions suggest he is conveying important information or making a point, as indicated by his open mouth and expressive gestures.<br>
                                6. Visual Composition: The camera is positioned at eye level, focusing on the man in the suit, with a clear view of his upper body and the documents on the desk, emphasizing the importance of the conversation.<br>
                                7. Environmental Acoustics: The space likely has a quiet, intimate acoustic property, suitable for a professional or academic setting where focused discussions take place.
